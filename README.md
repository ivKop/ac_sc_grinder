Schematic/PCB:

- [EasyEda project page](https://easyeda.com/speed/AC-speed-control-for-grinder) -
  you can order PCB & all components there in couple of clicks!

Note! Due size restrictions, it's impossible to create universal PCB for all
kinds of grinders. We prepared PCB for `Hilda 180W` - it's very popular and
cheap. Boards for other models are left to volunteers.
